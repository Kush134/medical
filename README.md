# AssemblyAI
#This is my submission for the AssemblyAI Hackathon

Lots of open source files here:
- To execute the files for the pre-recorded-audio files, run Streamlit filename.py
- For the 3D Model, run npm install followed by npm run dev
- To run the FaceRecognition files, use the run feature in your code editor. 


This hackathon has been quite the experience of skill, grit, and how much coffee the human body can sustain. 

Big thanks to the open source apps that helped me get this prototype out:
